# Notes on using git

Mathematica's `.nb` somehow should be considered as a binary file format which is very hard to use it with git.

As for mma12, `.wl => wolfram language package` should be used for git. `.wl` doesn't contains any output or additional metadata. It can also be recognised by default.
