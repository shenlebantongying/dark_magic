# Technical Notes

Each Lisp implementations have their very own "extensions". Portability can be achieved by avoid using them, but it may be exhausting. 

`SBCL` would be the primary one.

`ABCL` and `ECL` maybe considered.

`Clasp` looks promising for now.

If someday `Lispwork` lower their price for personal use........

For windows, just use the [`Portacle`](https://portacle.github.io/) to avoid all the troublesome.
