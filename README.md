# What?

My first programming language is weirdly [Mathematica (or Wolfram Language)](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/) , which is a modern functional programming language. Whatever, I lost my memory due to a series of accidents. This is repo is a centralised place to recover my memory via collecting my old code scatters across my old computers.

# Editing note

Emacs was, is and will still be the *de facto* editor for various functional programming lanugages.

| Lang   | Major modes |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Lisp   | SLIME       |
| scheme | Geiser      |
| Ocaml  | tuareg      |

Fortunately, they share a few keybindings

`C-c C-r` => eval region

`C-x C-e` => eval the last expression
